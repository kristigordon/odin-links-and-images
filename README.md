Repository to work through some Odin Project workshops. 

Refreshing myself on HTML/CSS and starting to work on Javascript again. 

Odin also gives you a good foundation by having you set up your local environmment first and teaching CLI and Git first so that you are deepening these skills throughout the courses.
